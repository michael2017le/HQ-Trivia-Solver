# HQ Trivia Solver
---
Created an HQ trivia solver during HackUTD 2018.

## Background
---
- **What is HQ?**
   HQ is a trivia game where a speaker asks questions **_live_** and you're given a short amount of time to answer the questions.  
   There is a cash prize but only the few that answers **EVERY** question correctly are eligible to claim the prize.  
   The prize can range anywhere from $1200 to more than $50,000 and the ones that answer every question correctly split the pot.  
   Depending on the prize at stake, the speaker asks anywhere from 8 to 15 questions.   

- **What is a HackUTD?**

   HackUTD is a hackathon hosted at the University of Texas at Dallas.  
   My first hackathon ever!

- **What is a "hackathon"?**

   Hackathons are events where a large number of individuals can work on **ANY** project they want and demo to judges!  
   Each participant can choose to work in a team or by themselves and the only limitation is their imagination.
