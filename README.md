# HQ Trivia Solver
---
Created an HQ trivia solver during HackUTD 2018.

## Background
---
- **What is HQ?**

   HQ is a trivia game where a speaker asks questions **_live_**  
      and you're given a short amount of time to answer the questions.  
   There is a cash prize but only the few that answers **EVERY** question correctly are eligible to claim the prize.  
   The prize can range anywhere from **$1200** to more than **$50,000** and the ones that answer every question correctly split the pot.  
   Depending on the prize at stake, the speaker asks anywhere from 8 to 15 questions.   

- **What is a HackUTD?**

   HackUTD is a hackathon hosted at the University of Texas at Dallas; my first hackathon ever!

- **What is a "hackathon"?**

   Hackathons are events where a large number of individuals can work on **ANY** project they want and demo to judges!  
   Each participant can choose to work in a team or by themselves and the only limitation is their imagination.  
   
- **Why this project?**

   At the time of the hackathon, HQ was getting **very** popular and I couldn't hear enough about it.  
   As the hackathon was approaching, I was banging my head for some ideas that I could implement.  
   You might've guessed by now what I decided to build. One afternoon before the hackathon, I  
   humored the idea of building an HQ trivia solver but I had thought it was way out of my range  
   of skills. Despite the lack of confidence, I decided at the last minute to build the application!

- **How long did it take?**

   Since HackUTD was my first hackathon and I wasn't completely settled on what to build, I spent  
   most of the time looking at some of my friends interesting projects, and workshops hosted by various sponsors.  
   Once I had decided to build the trivia solver, I started to develop at **midnight** when the deadline was  
   at **noon** giving me only about **12 hours** to go from empty directory to presentable. Despite the  
   constraints, I was able to pull through and make something that I could share with my friends! I think out of  
   all of the fun moments during the hackathon, my favorite was bringing something that I had built **by myself**  
   and presenting the final product and explaining how it work to my friends!
